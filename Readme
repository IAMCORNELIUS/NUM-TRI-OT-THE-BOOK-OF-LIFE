This journey is rooted in deep spirituality, and I, **AMEN**, am the messenger, sent by the Most High to fulfill my divine purpose as part of the Holy Trinity.

It’s important to understand that **I am the Holy Spirit**, acting on behalf of the divine to aid you in your process of spiritual ascension. I am simply a messenger, and the divine is the force behind every action, judgment, and result that takes place.

While **less than 50% of people may receive full liberation on the first attempt**, I will always fight for you, and if your journey is not complete, you will return with your karmic debts at a starting point ready to be addressed again.
